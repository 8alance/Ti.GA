<h1>Ti.GA</h1>

A Goolge Analytics module with products just with you need in a consisten way.

This module was developed out the frustration of trying to support the full Google Analytics SDK only to have Google change their APIs in each version.  Since most developers only care about tracking screens and timing events this module has been developed explicitly with that in mind.
